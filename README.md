**Hello.**  I am a software engineer with nearly 20 years of experience.  I have a keen interest in all things DX.  I love technology because it is a force multiplier.  In my eyes, good DX is a multiplier of a multiplier.  Anyone who has played video games can tell you how powerful those can be. :wink:

For the past several years I have been [contributing to Ruby on Rails](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/jonathan-hefner/commits), and I am a [member of the Rails committers team](https://rubyonrails.org/community#committers).
