**Hello!**  I am a software engineer with 20 years of experience.  I have a keen interest in all things DX.  I love technology because it's a force multiplier.  I see good DX as a multiplier of a multiplier.  Someone who's played video games can tell you how powerful those can be. ðŸ˜‰

For the past several years I have been [contributing to Ruby on Rails](https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/jonathan-hefner/commits), and I am a [member of the Rails committers team](https://rubyonrails.org/community#committers).

I also recently became a member of the [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) Steering Committee.  I'm very excited about the possiblities that MCP offers.  AIs are powerful but not necessarily robust.  Using MCP, developers can carve challenges out from a problem domain, and create reusable, reliable solutions.  AIs can then compose those solutions in bespoke ways.  It's like DX for the AI itself! ðŸ˜ƒ
